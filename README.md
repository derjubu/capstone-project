# Capstone Project for Web Developer Bootcamp

This is my final project for the web developer bootcamp at Neue Fische.
In the span of 4 weeks I created an app with which you can plan your route for your next vacation or keep track of the places you've been at.
The app is built with React and Styled Components, the design is oriented at Google's Material Design. I used the search and the map function from Mapbox to find and show locations, the data itself is stored in MongoDB.
Currently all data is stored at the same place, so everyone sees the same locations/can see, what location you added. I plan to implement a login function in the near future.
